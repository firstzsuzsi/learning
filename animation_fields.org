* ANIMATION
** Physics
** Drawing
*** Anatomy
*** Linework
*** Space
*** Perspective
*** Motion
** Mathematics
*** Geometry
*** Linear algebra
** 3D
*** Modeling
**** Poligonal
**** Sculpting
***** dintopo
***** masks
**** Subd
Build lowres, use subdiv
**** Boloean operations
Mainly hardsurface
**** Metaballs
**** Draw topology in orthographic projection
**** Extract shapes
***** Shrinkwrap
Lowres, shrinwrap hires to it
***** Retopology
**** Splines
***** make curve directly into object
***** screw
***** curve modifier
***** skin modifier
***** NURBS shapes
**** Mesh fill
Similar to curves, make mesh outline, fill it in with grid fill
**** Vector graphics to 3D
Spline tools
**** Shadowbox
Zbrush does it. Make projections, software creates the shape from them
**** Displacement
***** height map
***** vector displacement
**** Kitbashing
***** take ready made models and build a new one out of them
***** sculpt with the insert brushes
zbrush, find alternative in blender, like snapping, boolean operations
**** Photogrammetry
Point cloud, reality capture, create height (or vector maps)
**** Particles, force fields and metaballs
Megacool :D
**** Scatter particles
Hair, rubble etc.
**** CAD
Computer Aided Design
Fully math based stuff
**** Camera sync and poly modeling
Calibrate camera to fit image (set the camera tho the plane of the image), so the perspective fits and you just need to trace what you see.
**** Physics simulation
***** cloth
***** self fracrure
***** fluids
Ocean modifier, fluid sim
**** Math functons
XYZ mesh
**** Parametric modeling
Like Sverchok
**** Grammar based modeling
Generative modeling
**** Organic growth algorythms
Ivy mesh in Blender
DIffusion reactions
**** Fractals
Mandelbulber
**** Dynamic paint
Paint on an object with another one.
**** Voxels
**** Marching cubes
Poligonize volumetric data with marching cubes algorythm
**** Sculpting in VR
**** AI
NEural networks to generate from images etc.
*** Rigging
*** Aniamtion
